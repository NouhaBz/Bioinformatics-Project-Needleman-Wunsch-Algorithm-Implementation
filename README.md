# Bioinformatics Project: Needleman-Wunsch Algorithm Implementation

This project implements the **Needleman-Wunsch (NW) algorithm** for **global sequence alignment** in bioinformatics. The algorithm is widely used for aligning DNA, RNA, or protein sequences to identify similarities and evolutionary relationships.

## Features
- **Global Sequence Alignment**:
  - Implements the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for optimal alignment of two sequences.
  - Supports DNA, RNA, and protein sequence alignment.
- **Customizable Scoring System**:
  - Users can define match, mismatch, and gap penalties.
- **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
  - Efficient computation of alignment using matrix-based scoring and traceback.
- **Visualization of Alignment**:
  - Displays optimal sequence alignment with gaps and match indicators.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** for algorithm implementation.
- **NumPy** for efficient matrix operations.
- **Biopython (optional)** for sequence handling and data parsing.
- **Matplotlib** for alignment visualization.

## Installation & Usage
### Prerequisites
- Python (3.x)
- Required libraries: numpy, biopython, matplotlib

### Steps to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nw-alignment.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd nw-alignment
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the algorithm with sample sequences:
   ```bash
   python nw_algorithm.py "ACGTG" "ACGTC"
   ```
5. View alignment results in the console or graphical format.

## Future Enhancements
- Support for multiple sequence alignment (MSA)
- Integration with BLAST for database comparisons
- Improved visualization with interactive tools
